        "Task 3: -\n",
        "In this task the problem was to predict the winner of world cup 2023!! Now to address this task there were several problems listed below, and I tried to solve these problems one by one till the final problem of predicting the winner of world cup is solved.\n",
        "Problem Faced: -\n",
        "1)\tWhich dataset should be used?\n",
        "2)\tHow to preprocesses the data such that the model learns accurately?\n",
        "3)\tWhich model to select and which hyperparameters should be chosen in order to maximise the accuracy, precision and recall of the classification model\n",
        "Solution Used: -\n",
        "-\tTo solve the first problem, I first done the training and testing only dataset having 3 features team 1, team 2 and ground and the target column was winner. Here I trained and tested the random forest classifier on the selected dataset. Before training and testing I one hot encoded the team1,team2 and label encoded the ground column, and for the target variable I binarized it like if the first team is winning then the value will be assigned as 0 and if second teams wins 1 is assigned. The random forest classifier gave 60% testing accuracy and predicted that England will win the world cup.\n",
        "-\tThen I tried to add more features, namely NRR(net run rate, both the team), Points(both the team) and which team is batting first. On this dataset I trained several models\n",
        "-\tPreprocessing: - In preprocessing step I label encoded team 1, team 2 and ground then I encoded the winner team in binarized manner as discussed above and also label encoded the winner team and trained all the models on this 2 encodings(target column encoded as binary encoding and label encoding.)\n",
        "-\tImplemented models: - 1) XGboost, 2) Catboost, 3) LGBMclassifier, 4) DNN(having 4 hidden layers)\n",
        "-\tIn all the models DNN(deep neural network) and LGBM classifiers outperforms all the model with accuracy of 72.73% testing accuracy and above 98% training accuracy. Both the model predicts INDIA is going to win the world cup.\n",
        "-\tIn the DNN I used callbacks to save the best model parameters which gives highest validation accuracy also, used dropouts to reduce overfitting. Then in model.compile I used adam as optimizer and for binary encoded winner case loss function is binary_crossentropy and in the case where winner is encoded as label categorical_crossentropy is used.\n",
        "-\tThe model is trained on batch_size 32 and 100 epochs and gives 72.73% accuracy on tesing dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter tuning\n",
        "-\tIn hyperparameter tuning used grid search to find the optimal parameter of the choosed model.The results are shown in the google file 202101102_course_project_3."
